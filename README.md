# Android Fault Visualizer

Visually interpret the page fault patterns of an Android application.

## Getting Started

TODO:

- Generalize scripts
- Add notes on how to setup
- Verify this works for `extractNativeLibs=true`
- Verify this works for older versions of Android
- Analyze DEX files that are encoded in a `.odex` instead of embedded within the APK

Nice to haves:

- Improve the performance of notebooks
